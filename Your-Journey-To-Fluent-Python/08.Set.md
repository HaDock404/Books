## 1. Introduction to Sets

A set - is a <span style="color:red"> mutable, unordered collection of items in `Python`</span>. 

Every element <span style="color:green"> is unique (_no duplicates_)</span>. and <span style="color:orange">must be immutable (_cannot be changed_).</span>

### 1.1 Syntax

Sets can be created using curly braces `{}` or the set`()` function. However, an empty set can only be created using the `set()` function, using `{}` as it creates an empty _`dictionary`_.

#### Example

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}      
print(my_set)
print("Type is:", type(my_set))

empty_set = set()
print(empty_set)
print("Type of empty set is:", type(empty_set))

dictionary = {}         # Be careful it is NOT a ``set``
print(dictionary)
print("Type is:", type(dictionary))
```

#### Output
```
{1, 2, 3}
Type is: <class 'set'>
set()
Type of empty set is: <class 'set'>
{}
Type is: <class 'dict'>
```

### 1.2 Convert iterables into `sets`


Converting other iterables to sets can be useful for several reasons:

- **_Eliminating Duplicates_**: `Sets` automatically remove duplicate elements, which is useful for getting _unique items_.
- **_Efficient Membership Testing_**: Checking whether an item exists in a `set` is faster compared to `lists` or `tuples`.

As for me, it is very underestimated data sctructure among `py` devs' community, because based on my current experience I haven't seen many solutions where sets were used in production code.

The syntax for converting an iterable to a set involves the `set()` constructor.

#### Example

```python
# Converting a list to a set
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
my_set = set(my_list)
print(my_set)

# Converting a tuple to a set
my_tuple = (4, 5, 6, 5, 4)
my_set = set(my_tuple)
print(my_set)

# Converting a string to a set
my_string = "hello"
my_set = set(my_string)
print(my_set)
```

### Output
```
{1, 2, 3}
{4, 5, 6}
{'e', 'h', 'l', 'o'}
```

Bear in mind that the order of elements in `sets` can be different from time to time you output the elements.

### 1.3 Indexing and Slicing

Sets <span style="color:red">do NOT </span> support `indexing` or `slicing`.

This sounds logically, as there is no order in how elements are stored and they can't be accessed by index.

#### Example
```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}

# The following lines will raise an error
print(my_set[0])
print(my_set[0:2])
```

#### Output

```
TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable
```

### 1.4 Math operations and `built_in` functions.

You can do various math operations with `sets` in `Python`.

Python's built-in functions like `len()`, `max()`, `min()`, `sum()`, and `sorted()` can also be applied to sets.

![Alt text](images/Lesson-8-sets-operation.png)

#### Example
```python
# Define two sets
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}

# Perform set operations
union = A | B  # or A.union(B)
intersection = A & B  # or A.intersection(B)
difference = A - B  # or A.difference(B)
symmetric_difference = A ^ B  # or A.symmetric_difference(B)

# Display the results
print("Union:", union)
print("Intersection:", intersection)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Symmetric Difference:", symmetric_difference)

# Apply built-in functions
length = len(A)
max_value = max(A)
min_value = min(A)
sum_value = sum(A)
sorted_list = sorted(A)  # Note: sorted() returns a list

# Display the results
print("Length:", length)
print("Max:", max_value)
print("Min:", min_value)
print("Sum:", sum_value)
print("Sorted:", sorted_list)

# Membership test
print("-" * 10)
print(1 in A)
print("A" in A)
```

#### Output
```
Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Intersection: {3}
Difference: {1, 2}
Symmetric Difference: {1, 2, 4, 5}
Length: 3
Max: 3
Min: 1
Sum: 6
Sorted: [1, 2, 3]
----------
True
False
```

### 1.5 Set Comparisons

Set comparison operators in Python enable you to compare sets based on their contents, allowing you to check for subset, superset, or equality relationships. These operations are particularly useful when dealing with collections of elements where the focus is on the presence or absence of items rather than their order or frequency.

### 1.5.1 Subset and Superset

- A **subset** (`<`) is a set where all its elements are contained within another set.
- A **superset** (`>`) is a set that contains all elements of another set.

Python provides the `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` operators, along with the methods `.issubset()`, `.issuperset()` for these comparisons.

### 1.5.2 Equality

- Two sets are considered **equal** (`==`) if they contain the same elements, regardless of their order.

#### Example
```python
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
C = {1, 2, 3}

# Checking for subset
is_subset = A < B  # or A.issubset(B)
print(f"A is a subset of B: {is_subset}")

# Checking for superset
is_superset = B > A  # or B.issuperset(A)
print(f"B is a superset of A: {is_superset}")

# Checking for equality
is_equal = A == C
print(f"A is equal to C: {is_equal}")

# Using <= and >= for subset and superset including equality
is_subset_or_equal = A <= C
is_superset_or_equal = B >= C
print(f"A is a subset or equal to C: {is_subset_or_equal}")
print(f"B is a superset or equal to C: {is_superset_or_equal}")

# Non-equivalence
is_not_equal = B != C
print(f"B is not equal to C: {is_not_equal}")
```

#### Output
```
A is a subset of B: True
B is a superset of A: True
A is equal to C: True
A is a subset or equal to C: True
B is a superset or equal to C: True
B is not equal to C: True
```

## 2. Methods of `sets`

Python sets come with methods that allow you to modify set elements and compare sets in various ways.

### 2.1 Adding and Removing Elements

| Method          | Description                                                                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `add(element)`          | Adds an element to the set.                                                                         |
| `remove(element)`       | Removes an element from the set. Raises a `KeyError` if the element is not present.                 |
| `discard(element)`      | Removes an element from the set if it is a member. If the element is not a member, does nothing.    |
| `pop()`                 | Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set. Raises a `KeyError` if the set is empty.     |
| `clear()`               | Removes all elements from the set.                                                                  |

### 2.2 Set Operations

| Method                         | Description                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `union(*others)`               | Returns a new set with elements from the set and all others.                                         |
| `intersection(*others)`        | Returns a new set with elements common to the set and all others.                                    |
| `difference(*others)`          | Returns a new set with elements in the set that are not in the others.                               |
| `symmetric_difference(other)`  | Returns a new set with elements in either the set or other but not both.                             |
| `update(*others)`              | Updates the set, adding elements from all others.                                                    |
| `intersection_update(*others)` | Updates the set, keeping only elements found in it and all others.                                   |
| `difference_update(*others)`   | Updates the set, removing elements found in others.                                                  |
| `symmetric_difference_update(other)` | Updates the set, keeping only elements found in either set, but not in both.                      |

#### Example

```python
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}

# Add and remove elements
A.add(4)
A.discard(2)
print(f"After add and discard: {A}")

# Set operations
union_set = A.union(B)
intersection_set = A.intersection(B)
difference_set = A.difference(B)
print(f"Union: {union_set}")
print(f"Intersection: {intersection_set}")
print(f"Difference: {difference_set}")
```

#### Output
```
After add and discard: {1, 3, 4}
Union: {1, 3, 4, 5}
Intersection: {3, 4}
Difference: {1}
```

## 3. `Set` Comprehensions

Just like for list comprehensions, there is a support for set comprehensions as well.

#### Example
```python
# Create a set of squares using set comprehension
squares = {x**2 for x in range(10)}
print(squares)

# Create a set from a list where only even numbers are stored
evens = {x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}
print(evens)
```

#### Output
```
{0, 1, 64, 4, 36, 9, 16, 49, 81, 25}
{0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
```

## 4. `frozenset()` Overview

A `frozenset` is the immutable version of a set. Once created, items cannot be added or removed from a `frozenset`.

This immutability makes `frozenset` instances hashable, so they can be used as keys in dictionaries or as elements in other sets.

#### Example
```python
immutable_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
print(immutable_set)

# Attempt to add an element (This will raise an error)
try:
    immutable_set.add(4)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(e)
```

#### Output
```
frozenset({1, 2, 3})
'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'
```
