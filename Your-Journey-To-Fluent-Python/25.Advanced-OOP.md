## 1. Mixins

Mixins are a sort of class designed to offer optional methods or functionality to other classes.

They are a form of multiple inheritance, allowing developers to add the same functionality to multiple classes without repeating code.

**IMPORTANT**: Unlike traditional base classes, mixins are specifically designed to be combined with other classes, not to stand on their own.

### 1.1 The Purpose of Mixins

They are used to modularize functionality, making it easy to add or remove features from objects without afecting the inheritance hierarchy of the classes. They can:

- Provide a set of methods that can be used in different classes.
- Compose behaviors in classes.
- Add functionality to classes without modifying them directly.

Generally, the main idea is to make mixins generic as possible, defining functionality to use them in different classes which serve different purpose.

### 1.2 Implementation

A mixin is typically implemented as a class that does not work by itself. As I mentioned before, it must be combined with another class to make sense.

#### Example

```python
class JsonMixin:
    import json

    def to_json(self):
        return self.json.dumps(self.__dict__)

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

class Car(JsonMixin, Vehicle):  # Mixin
    def __init__(self, brand, model, engine_type):
        super().__init__(brand, model)
        self.engine_type = engine_type

my_car = Car("Tesla", "Model S", "Electric")
print(my_car.to_json()) # Call external functionality frim ``JsonMixin`` class
```

#### Output
```
{"brand": "Tesla", "model": "Model S", "engine_type": "Electric"}
```

#### Explanation

In this example, `JsonMixin` provides a `to_json` method, which is then available to the `Car` class through multiple inheritance. This is a simple yet powerful way to add functionality to classes without affecting their logic.

Let's create another mixin that adds logging functionality to any class. 

#### Example

```python
import logging

class LoggingMixin:
    @property
    def logger(self):
        name = '.'.join([self.__class__.__module__, self.__class__.__name__])
        return logging.getLogger(name)

    def log_info(self, message):
        self.logger.info(message)

    def log_error(self, message):
        self.logger.error(message)

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class DataProcessor(LoggingMixin):
    def process_data(self, data):
        self.log_info(f"Processing data: {data}")
        if data == "error":
            self.log_error("An error occurred while processing data.")

processor = DataProcessor()
processor.process_data("some data")
processor.process_data("error")
```

### Output

```
INFO:__main__.DataProcessor:Processing data: some data
INFO:__main__.DataProcessor:Processing data: error
ERROR:__main__.DataProcessor:An error occurred while processing data.
```

#### Explanation

``LoggingMixin`` uses the `@property` decorator for `logger` to ensure that the logger is specific to the class it's mixed into, using the class's fully qualified name. 

This makes the logs clearer and more informative because they're automatically tagged with the class name. As well it remains generic ass possible and can be injected into any class being an extremely powerful tool.

### 1.3 Best Practices

1.**Single Responsibility**: Each mixin should be focused on a single, clear purpose, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.
```python
import json

class JsonMixin:
    def to_json(self):
        """Serialize data to a JSON format."""
        return json.dumps(self.__dict__)

class Person(JsonMixin):
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Usage
person = Person("John Doe", 30)
print(person.to_json())  # {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}
```

**IMPORTANT**: `JsonMixin` can be integrated in ANY class, I am intentionally including the same example as above to show that we can use it not only with a class `Car` but with a `Person` as well.

#### Output

```
{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}
```

2.**Avoid State in Mixins**: Ideally, mixins should not store state. If they must, be cautious of conflicts with the classes they are mixed into.

```python
class DebuggingMixin:
    def debug_method_call(self, method_name):
        print(f"Method called: {method_name}")

class Calculation(DebuggingMixin):
    def add(self, a, b):
        self.debug_method_call('add')
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        self.debug_method_call('subtract')
        return a - b

# Usage
calc = Calculation()
print(calc.add(10, 5))
print(calc.subtract(10, 5))
```

#### Output

```
Method called: add
15
Method called: subtract
5
```

3.**Use Descriptive Names**: Since mixins can be combined in various ways, their names should be as descriptive as possible to clarify their purpose and functionality, as everything in Python.

```python
import base64

class EncryptionDecryptionMixin:
    def encrypt_data(self, data):
        """Encrypts data using base64 encoding."""
        return base64.b64encode(data.encode('utf-8'))

    def decrypt_data(self, data):
        """Decrypts data using base64 decoding."""
        return base64.b64decode(data).decode('utf-8')

class SecureCommunicator(EncryptionDecryptionMixin):
    def send_secure_message(self, message):
        encrypted_message = self.encrypt_data(message)
        print(f"Sending encrypted message: {encrypted_message}")

    def receive_secure_message(self, encrypted_message):
        message = self.decrypt_data(encrypted_message)
        print(f"Received message: {message}")

comm = SecureCommunicator()
encrypted = comm.encrypt_data("Hello World")
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted}")
print("Decrypted:", comm.decrypt_data(encrypted))
```

#### Output
```
Encrypted: b'SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ='
Decrypted: Hello World
```

4.**Be Mindful of the Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: Python's method resolution order means that the order of base classes affects the methods used. 

```python
class BaseFeature:
    def feature(self):
        print("Base feature")

class EnhancementMixin:
    def feature(self):
        print("Enhanced feature")

class AdditionalFeatureMixin:
    def feature(self):
        super().feature()
        print("Additional feature")

class Product(EnhancementMixin, AdditionalFeatureMixin, BaseFeature):
    pass

product = Product()
product.feature()  # Will call EnhancementMixin's feature due to MRO
```

Again, based on my experience mixins are very underestimated, but hopefully you will be able to find where they could be applied potentially. 

## 2. Metaclasses  

Metaclasses define how a class behaves, they define the rules for class objects. A class is an instance of a metaclass, just as an object is an instance of a class.


### 2.1 Syntax 

In Python, the type `type` is the built-in metaclass that is used by default, but custom metaclasses can be created by inheriting from `type`. In order to create a metaclass you need to be inheriting from `type` and defining the `__new__` or `__init__` method.

#### Example

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # custom logic here
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
```

To use a metaclass, you specify it in the class definition using the `metaclass` keyword.

```python
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
      pass
```


The `__new__` method in `Python` is a special method used for creating and returning a new instance of a class. 

It is important to understand, unlike `__init__`, which initializes an already existing instance, `__new__` is responsible for actually creating the instance.


#### Example

```python
class MyClass:
    def __new__(cls):
        print("Creating instance")
        instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return instance

    def __init__(self):
        print("Initializing instance")

# When you create a new instance of MyClass
obj = MyClass()
```

#### Output
```
# Creating instance
# Initializing instance
```

In some cases, you might override `__new__` when you need to control the creation of a new instance, such as enforcing a Singleton Pattern (ensuring a class only ever has one instance) or modifying the instantiation process of a subclass.

### 2.2 Real world examples
Suppose you want to add a debugging method to a range of classes to print their attributes in a formatted manner for easier debugging. 

Instead of adding the method to each class manually, you can create a metaclass that automatically injects this method into any class that uses it, that's how we ensure that we have a controll on the stage of creation of a new instance.

### 2.2.1 Debugging Metaclass

```python
class DebugMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Define a new method
        def debug(self):
            attrs = "\n".join(f"{key}={value}" for key, value in self.__dict__.items())
            print(f"Debugging {self.__class__.__name__}:\n{attrs}")
        
        # Add the method to the class
        dct["debug"] = debug
        
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)


class Product(metaclass=DebugMeta):
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

class Customer(metaclass=DebugMeta):
    def __init__(self, id, name):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name

# While creating instances 
# (before ``__init__`` ``__new__`` will be called and assign attributes of classes which use ``DebugMeta``
product = Product("Laptop", 1200)
customer = Customer("001", "John Doe")

# Using the new method
product.debug()
customer.debug()
```

#### Output

```
Debugging Product:
name=Laptop
price=1200
Debugging Customer:
id=001
name=John Doe
```

#### Explanation

- The `DebugMeta` metaclass defines a `debug` method inside the `__new__` method and adds it to every class that specifies `DebugMeta` as its metaclass.
- By using this metaclass, any class can automatically gain the `debug` method without explicitly defining it. This is powerful for adding functionality like logging, debugging, serialization, and more across multiple classes.

Now, developers have flexibility in extending class functionality and this can be particularly useful in large applications or libraries.

### 2.2.2. Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

Django, Python web framework, uses metaclasses to define models that represent database tables. The `ModelBase` metaclass in Django's ORM system allows developers to define models using simple class syntax, which the metaclass then translates into database fields and tables. 

This abstraction enables developers to work with databases in a more Pythonic way, without having to write SQL queries for basic operations.

**Example Use Case:**

```python
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()

    class Meta:
        db_table = 'person_table'
```

#### Explanataion
`models.Model` uses a metaclass to process the class attributes (`name` and `age`) and convert them into database columns. 

The metaclass also handles inheritance, database schema generation, and integrates with Django's migrations system to apply changes to the database schema over time.


Unfortunately, Django framework is beyond the scope of this book, as it is enormously big framework which will require a separate book to be written in order to describe its functionality, but you can refere to the [official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/) and try building web apps by yourself, as your knowledge should be enough already. 

### 2.2.3 SQLAlchemy's Declarative Base

SQLAlchemy, a popular SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, utilizes metaclasses to define a declarative base class. 

#### Example

```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    age = Column(Integer)
```

#### Explanation

The `declarative_base()` function in SQLAlchemy uses a metaclass to create a base class, which then automatically maps class properties to database table columns. Due to metaclasses the ORM simplifies the creation of models and their associated database operations.


**_IMPORTANT_:** Be careful using metaclasses, they can introduce complexity and should only be used when simpler solutions like class inheritance or decorators are insufficient.

Metaclasses can automatically validate or modify member attributes. This can be useful for type checking or automatically adding `getter/setter` methods to attributes.

## 3. Type checking 

You can annotate variables, function parameters, and return types using custom classes just as you would with built-in types. This tells the reader of the code, as well as static type checkers, exactly what kind of object is expected.

**Example:**

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make: str, model: str):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

def display_car_info(car: Car) -> str:
    return f"{car.make} {car.model}"

# Correct usage
my_car: Car = Car("Tesla", "Model S")
info: str = display_car_info(my_car)

wrong_car: int = 123
display_car_info(wrong_car)  # Mypy will flag this as an error
```

### 3.1 Conditional Imports

When working with type hints that refer to classes defined in external modules, you might encounter a situation where you want to avoid importing those modules directly at runtime. 


Python's `typing.TYPE_CHECKING` constant can be used in these cases to conditionally import modules for type annotations without affecting runtime performance.

#### Example 

```python
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from some_external_module import ExternalClass

def func(arg: 'ExternalClass') -> None:
    pass
```

Note the use of a string literal `'ExternalClass'` in the function signature. This is a forward declaration, which is necessary because the actual `ExternalClass` is not imported at runtime.

Having this practices can reduce circular imports, which is the worst error to be tackled, as well, improve readability and the code will be less prune to errors.

### 3.2 Runtime Type Checking

Python's dynamic nature allows for flexibility in handling different types, but there are scenarios where enforcing type safety at runtime is necessary, especially when interfacing with external systems or libraries.

### 3.2.1 `isinstance()`

The `isinstance()` function checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or a tuple of classes. It's a straightforward way to validate types at runtime, ensuring that the data conforms to the expected type before proceeding.

#### Example
```python
def process_data(data):
    if not isinstance(data, dict):
        raise ValueError("Expected a dictionary")
    # process data here
```

In this case we want to work only with a `dict` class and its subclasses, inheritance is taken into consideration as well.

#### Example

Suppose we have a class hierarchy where `Animal` is a base class, and `Dog` and `Cat` are subclasses. We might want to write a function that behaves differently based on whether it's given a `Dog` or a `Cat`.


```python
class Animal:
    pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def meow(self):
        return "Meow!"

def make_sound(animal):
    if isinstance(animal, Dog):
        print(animal.bark())
    elif isinstance(animal, Cat):
        print(animal.meow())
    else:
        raise TypeError("make_sound only accepts Dog or Cat instances")

# Usage
make_sound(Dog())
make_sound(Cat())
```

#### Output

```
Woof!
Meow!
```
In this way, we handle different scenarios based on the object type, calling `isinstance()` function.

### 3.2.2 `type()`

While `isinstance()` checks an object's type against a class or a tuple of classes considering inheritance, `type()` is used to get the exact type of an object without considering subclassing. This can be useful for type checking that needs to ignore the inheritance hierarchy.

#### Example 

```python
class MyBaseClass:
    pass

class MyDerivedClass(MyBaseClass):
    pass

obj = MyDerivedClass()

if type(obj) is MyDerivedClass:
    print("obj is exactly MyDerivedClass")
else:
    print("obj is not exactly MyDerivedClass")
```

#### Output

```
obj is exactly MyDerivedClass
```

Or we can implement something similar to the example avoiding subclass interference.

```python
if type(obj) is MyBaseClass:
    print("obj is exactly MyBaseClass and not a subclass")
else:
    print("obj is a subclass of MyBaseClass or an unrelated class")
```

#### Output

```
obj is a subclass of MyBaseClass or an unrelated class
```

Based on the table we could see when and which function should be used. 

Personally, I don't like using `type()` in production code, as it can be dangerous if we want
to work within inheritance paradigm and can lead to unexpected bugs or changing behaivours. But again, you will not find out what is best for your application unless trying. 

### 3.2.3 `isinstance()` vs `type()` 

| Feature | `isinstance()` | `type()` |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Checks inheritance | Yes, considers an object an instance if it's derived from the class. | No, checks for the object's immediate type only. |
| Use case | Ideal for polymorphic behavior where subclass instances should be treated as instances of the base class. | When you need to distinguish an object's exact type, especially to differentiate between a class and its subclass. |
| Syntax | `isinstance(object, class_or_tuple)` | `type(object) is SomeClass` |

### 3.2.4 Type Guards 

Type guards are constructs that explicitly check and narrow down the type of variables within a certain scope, making it safer to perform operations that are type-specific. You would want to use them when dealing with union types or the `Any` type, where the specific type might not be clear

#### Example
```python
from typing import Union

def double(value: Union[int, str]):
    if isinstance(value, str):
        # The type of value is narrowed down to str here
        return value * 2
    elif isinstance(value, int):
        # The type of value is narrowed down to int here
        return value + value

print(double(11))
print(double('11'))
```


#### Output

```
22
1111
```

#### Explanation

In this code, `value` can be either an `int` or a `str`. The `isinstance()` checks act as type guards, narrowing down the type of `value` within each block and allowing for type-specific operations. That can useful in case we want to handle different operations with different approaches.

## 4. Duck Typing


The main concept of duck typing is that, a function can accept any object that has the required attributes or methods, regardless of the object's class.


> "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck"

#### Example


```python
def quack_and_fly(thing):
    thing.quack()
    thing.fly()
    print("This thing looks like a duck and quacks like a duck.")

class Duck:
    def quack(self):
        print("Quack, quack!")

    def fly(self):
        print("Flap, flap!")

class Airplane:
    def fly(self):
        print("Whoosh!")

class Person:
    def quack(self):
        print("I'm quacking like a duck!")

    def fly(self):
        print("I'm flapping my arms!")

duck = Duck()
airplane = Airplane()
person = Person()

quack_and_fly(duck)      # This works fine
quack_and_fly(person)    # This works fine

# This will raise an AttributeError, because `airplane` has no `quack` method.
quack_and_fly(airplane)  
```

#### Output

```
Quack, quack!
Flap, flap!
This thing looks like a duck and quacks like a duck.
I'm quacking like a duck!
I'm flapping my arms!
This thing looks like a duck and quacks like a duck.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 32, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 2, in quack_and_fly
AttributeError: 'Airplane' object has no attribute 'quack'
```


#### Explanation 
- Despite their different types, all these objects can be used in the `quack_and_fly()` function
- In case with airplane, we can use ``Type Guards``  to check the types passed or call ``hasattr()`` function to check if an object has a certain attribute or method before calling it.
- Due to the fact that `Python` is a dynamical language, we can't really strictly enforce Python to define the type explicitly.  

Duck typing is more than just a theoretical concept. It has practical applications in real-world scenarios, especially in web development.

#### Example 

Consider a web application framework that needs to handle different types of `HTTP` requests. Instead of checking the type of request, you can rely on the presence of a method to handle it.

```python
class GetRequestHandler:
    def handle(self, request):
        # process the GET request
        return "Handling GET request"

class PostRequestHandler:
    def handle(self, request):
        # process the POST request
        return "Handling POST request"

def process_request(handler, request):
    return handler.handle(request)

# Both GetRequestHandler and PostRequestHandler can be passed to process_request
get_handler = GetRequestHandler()
post_handler = PostRequestHandler()

print(process_request(get_handler, 'test'))  # As long as it has a handle method, it works
print(process_request(post_handler, 'test'))
```


#### Output
```
Handling GET request
Handling POST request
```

#### Example
In data analysis, you might encounter different data sources. Here's how duck typing allows you to write generic data loading functions:

```python
class CSVDataLoader:
    def load_data(self, source):
        print(f"Loading data from a CSV file: {source}")

class ExcelDataLoader:
    def load_data(self, source):
        print(f"Loading data from an Excel file: {source}")

class SQLDataLoader:
    def load_data(self, source):
        print(f"Loading data from a SQL database: {source}")

def load_data_from_any_source(loader, source):
    loader.load_data(source)

csv_loader = CSVDataLoader()
excel_loader = ExcelDataLoader()
sql_loader = SQLDataLoader()

load_data_from_any_source(csv_loader, "data.csv")
load_data_from_any_source(excel_loader, "data.xlsx")
load_data_from_any_source(sql_loader, "database.sqldb")
```

#### Output

```
Loading data from a CSV file: data.csv
Loading data from an Excel file: data.xlsx
Loading data from a SQL database: database.sqldb
```

**_IMPORTANT_:** Duck typing requires careful handling, though it has a high flexebility, it can lead to potential pitfalls inside the app and situations where it's a disadvantage, rather than an advantage. 

During designing your application, don't hesitate to look at this table, it can help you to decide the best approach to be used:


### 4.1 Duck Typing

| OOP Concept | Advantages | Potential Drawbacks | Use-Case Scenarios |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Duck Typing | - Flexibility<br>- Less boilerplate<br>- Natural polymorphism | - Possible runtime errors<br>- Less explicit type safety | - Small scripts<br>- When behavior is a priority over type |


```python
class Duck:
    def quack(self):
        print("Quack")

def make_sound(animal):
    animal.quack()

daffy = Duck()
make_sound(daffy)
```

### 4.2 Explicit Type Checking

| OOP Concept | Advantages | Potential Drawbacks | Use-Case Scenarios |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Explicit Type Checking | - Clear type contracts<br>- Compile-time error detection | - More boilerplate<br>- Less flexibility | - Large systems<br>- Safety-critical applications |


```python
def process_data(data):
    if not isinstance(data, dict):
        raise ValueError("Expected a dictionary")
    # process data here
```

### 4.3 Abstract Base Classes (ABC)

| OOP Concept | Advantages | Potential Drawbacks | Use-Case Scenarios |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Abstract Base Classes | - Enforces an interface<br>- Explicit contracts between code parts | - Requires more upfront design<br>- Can be overkill for simple cases | - Plugin systems<br>- Framework development |


```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AbstractAnimal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(AbstractAnimal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Woof!")

fido = Dog()
fido.sound()
```

### 4.4 Static Typing (Type Hints, `mypy`)

| OOP Concept | Advantages | Potential Drawbacks | Use-Case Scenarios |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Static Typing | - Early error detection<br>- Improved IDE support and code completion | - Additional complexity in annotations<br>- Steeper learning curve for new Python users | - Large codebases<br>- Applications with a long lifecycle |

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f'Hello, {name}'

greeting = greet("Alice")
print(greeting)
```

Ultimately, the choice of when and how to use these concepts depends on the specific requirements of your project, your team's preferences, and the need to balance development speed with code safety and maintainability.

Personally, I prefer more explicit type checking, static typing for large projects, and Abstract Base Classes. Not a big fun of duck typing, as all the time you have a feeling that something will break :)

Enough theory for today, try it yourself!
