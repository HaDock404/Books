## 1. Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (`regex` or `regexp`) are a powerful tool for processing text. 

They allow you to specify a pattern of text to search for in a string.

### 1.1 Use cases 

Generally, we need regular expressions for string data and the follwoing use cases: 

| Use Case               | Description                                                                                                      | Notes/Examples                                                   |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Validation**         | Ensuring that strings match a specific format to ensure data integrity and consistency.                          | Validating formats like email addresses, phone numbers, URLs. |
| **Search and Replace** | Finding and replacing substrings within a larger text body.                                                     | Useful in code editing, data cleaning, and log processing.      |
| **Data Extraction**    | Extracting information from structured text for analysis or format migration.                                    | Parsing data from log files, spreadsheets, or HTML documents. |
| **Text Parsing**       | Splitting text into tokens or segments based on patterns.                                                       | Aids in analyzing complex strings or constructing parsers.      |
| **Complex Pattern Matching** | Identifying patterns within text not easily described by standard string methods.                               | Identifying specific word sequences or characters with variable amounts of whitespace. |


### 1.2 Example

I want to scary you in advance and show a complicated regular expression used to validate an email address, so that you know what you could expect from the lesson:

```python
import re

# Email validation pattern
email_pattern = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$"

email = "example@test.com"

# Check if the pattern matches the email
if re.match(email_pattern, email):
    print("Valid email address.")
else:
    print("Invalid email address.")
```

It's extremely important and useful tool to have in a programming arsenal, but don't get scary we will find out how to work with regex very soon.


## 2. Basic Patterns

Regular expressions use a combination of literal characters and special characters to define patterns for matching strings.

For working with regular expressions in Python we would need to import and use `re` module. During this lesson, I will try to introduce some functionality from this module and explain everything within inline comments above.

### 2.1 Literal Characters

Literal characters are the simplest form of pattern matching in regular expressions.

They match exactly the characters specified in the regex pattern. For instance, the regex pattern `cat` will match the string "cat" in any larger string.

### 2.2 Example

```python
import re

text = "The cat sat on the mat."
pattern = "cat"

# Finding "cat" in the text
match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print("Match found:", match.group())
else:
    print("No match found.")
```

#### Output

```
Match found: cat
```

#### Assigment 1:

Find words UK and Britain in the following poem.

#### Poem

```python
poem =
"""
In the heart of the UK, where stories entwine,
Across the grand landscapes, where the sun dares to shine.
A tapestry rich, in green and in grey,
Where history whispers, in Britain, they say.
A land where the past and future remain.
"""
```

### 2.2 Special Characters and Sequences

Special characters and sequences represent specific instructions in regex (I mean that how the regex iitself should look like).

| Character | Description | Example Pattern | Example Match |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| `.` (Dot) | Matches any single character except newline (`\n`). | `a.c` | Matches "abc", "arc", "a3c". |
| `^` (Caret) | Matches the start of a string. | `^Hello` | Matches "Hello" at the beginning of a string. |
| `$` (Dollar) | Matches the end of a string. | `end$` | Matches "The end" in "This is the end". |
| `*` (Asterisk) | Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding element. | `bo*` | Matches "boooo" in "A ghost said boooo". |
| `+` (Plus) | Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding element. | `a+` | Matches "a" and "aaaa" in "caaaaaat". |
| `?` (Question Mark) | Makes the preceding element optional, matching 0 or 1 occurrence. | `colou?r` | Matches both "color" and "colour". |
| `{n}` (Curly Brackets) | Matches exactly `n` occurrences of the preceding element. | `a{2}` | Only matches "aa" in "caaat". |


Let's use a regular expression to find all instances that match a pattern in a given text. We'll combine several special characters to demonstrate their usage.

***IMPORTANT***: Try not to move to the explanation parts for the following examples, and based on the table, identify what exactly this pattern wants to achieve.

### 2.3 Example 

**Pattern**: `^T.*end$`

**Text**: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog to reach the end"

```python
import re

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog to reach the end"
pattern = "^T.*end$"

# Using re.findall to search for the pattern
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog to reach the end']
```

#### Explanation

This pattern seeks strings that start with "T", followed by any characters (including none), and end with "end".

### 2.4 Example

**Pattern**: `^a.*z$`

**Text**: "A to z"

```python
import re

text = "A to z"
pattern = "^a.*z$"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['A to z']
```

#### Explanation

This regex pattern is designed to find strings that start with "a" and end with "z", with any characters in between.


### 2.5 Example

**Pattern**: `\d+`

**Text**: "There are 123 apples"


```python
import re

text = "There are 123 apples"
pattern = "\d+"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

**Output**

```
Matches found: ['123']
```

**Explanation**

This regex pattern aims to find one or more digits in the text.

### 2.6 Example

**Pattern**: `f.?o`

**Text**: "The quick brown fo jumps over the lazy dog to reach the end. ffo also matches."

```python
import re

text = "The quick brown fo jumps over the lazy dog to reach the end. ffo also matches."
pattern = "f.?o"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['fo', 'ffo']
```

**Explanation**

The pattern `f.?o` matches strings that start with "f", followed by 
This regex pattern is designed to find "fo" with zero or one character between "f" and "o".

## 3. Character Classes

Character classes allow you to match specific sets of characters within a string. There are 2 types of character classes: `predefined` and `custom`.

Let's take a look on them:

### 3.1 Predefined

That is the default way, I would even say, a built in option of woriking regular expressions

| Class | Description | Equivalent |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `\d`  | Matches any digit | `[0-9]` |
| `\D`  | Matches any non-digit character | `[^0-9]` |
| `\s`  | Matches any whitespace character (including spaces, tabs, and line breaks) | |
| `\S`  | Matches any non-whitespace character | |
| `\w`  | Matches any word character (letters, digits, and underscores) | |
| `\W`  | Matches any non-word character | |

### 3.2 Custom

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `[abc]` | Matches any one of the characters `a`, `b`, or `c`. |
| `[^abc]` | Matches any character that is not `a`, `b`, or `c`. |
| `[a-z]` | Matches any lowercase letter. |
| `[A-Z]` | Matches any uppercase letter. |
| `[0-9]` | Matches any digit (same as `\d`). |


To be honest, there is nothing much can be told in terms of theory,  anywhere across this lesson. Let's dive into practice!


### 3.3 Example

**Pattern**: `\d{2,4}`

**Text**: "The year 2023 marks the event."

```python
import re

text = "The year 2023 marks the event."
pattern = "\d{2,4}"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['2023']
```

#### Explanation

This regex pattern aims to find sequences of digits where there are 2 to 4 digits in a row, matching years or other numerical data within that range.

### 3.4 Example

**Pattern**: `[A-Za-z]+`

**Text**: "Regex101 is a great tool!"

```python
import re

text = "Regex101 is a great tool!"
pattern = "[A-Za-z]+"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['Regex', 'is', 'a', 'great', 'tool']
```

#### Explanation

The pattern `[A-Za-z]+` matches one or more consecutive letters, capturing words in the sentence. 

### Example 3.5

**Pattern**: `[^0-9\s]+`

**Text**: "Error 404: Not Found."

```python
import re

text = "Error 404: Not Found."
pattern = "[^0-9\s]+"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['Error', ':', 'Not', 'Found.']
```

**Explanation**

Matches sequences of characters that are not digits or whitespaces.

### Example 3.6

**Pattern**: `\d+`

**Text**: "There are 15 apples in 4 baskets."

```python
import re

text = "There are 15 apples in 4 baskets."
pattern = "\d+"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['15', '4']
```

#### Explanation

Find one or more digits in the text, effectively extracting all numerical values.

---

### 3.7 Example

**Pattern**: `\w+`

**Text**: "Hello, world! Regex is amazing."

```python
import re

text = "Hello, world! Regex is amazing."
pattern = "\w+"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['Hello', 'world', 'Regex', 'is', 'amazing']
```

#### Explanation

Matches sequences of word characters (letters, digits, underscores), capturing words in the sentence.

---

### 3.8 Example

**Pattern**: `[aeiou]`

**Text**: "Regular expressions are powerful."

```python
import re

text = "Regular expressions are powerful."
pattern = "[aeiou]"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['e', 'u', 'a', 'e', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'a', 'e', 'o', 'e', 'u']
```

#### Explanation

Matches any vowel in the text, targeting specific subsets of characters.

## 4. Quantifiers

Quantifiers in regular expressions define how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present for a match to occur.

| Quantifier | Description | Example Pattern | Matches |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| `*`        | Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding element. | `a*b` | "b", "ab", "aab", "aaab", ... |
| `+`        | Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding element. | `a+b` | "ab", "aab", "aaab", ... |
| `?`        | Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding element, making it optional. | `a?b` | "b", "ab" |
| `{n}`      | Matches exactly `n` occurrences of the preceding element. | `a{2}b` | "aab" |
| `{n,}`     | Matches `n` or more occurrences of the preceding element. | `a{2,}b` | "aab", "aaab", "aaaab", ... |
| `{n,m}`    | Matches between `n` and `m` occurrences of the preceding element, inclusive. | `a{2,3}b` | "aab", "aaab" |

### 4.1 Greedy vs Lazy Quantification

Quantifiers are greedy by default, meaning they match as many occurrences of the pattern as possible.

For a better performance, we could make them lazy by appending a `?` to them, causing them to match as few characters as needed for the pattern to succeed.

I guess, let's dive into practice again?

### 4.2 Example

**Pattern**: `a.*c`

**Text**: "abcabc"

```python
import re

text = "abcabc"
pattern = "a.*c"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['abcabc']
```

#### Explanation

The greedy quantifier `.*` matches as many characters as possible between `a` and `c`, capturing the entire string "abcabc".

---

### 4.3 Example

**Pattern**: `a.*?c`

**Text**: "abcabc"

```python
import re

text = "abcabc"
pattern = "a.*?c"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['abc', 'abc']
```

#### Explanation

By making the quantifier lazy (`.*?`), the pattern matches as little as possible, resulting in two separate matches "abc" and "abc", instead of the entire string.

---

### 4.4 Example

**Pattern**: `a{2,3}`

**Text**: "aaaaa"

```python
import re

text = "aaaaa"
pattern = "a{2,3}"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['aaa', 'aa']
```

#### Explanation

Matches between 2 and 3 occurrences of `a`. Actually, that is a great example which shows how to specify exact or ranges of repetitions in a pattern itself.


## 5. Anchors and Boundaries

Anchors and boundaries do not match characters but rather match positions within the input text.

They are used to assert that the required match is at a particular position in the text.

### 5.1 Boundaries

The word boundary anchor `\b` is used to denote the boundaries of words. It allows a regular expression to specify that a given pattern must occur at the beginning or end of a word within the text.

- **`\bWORD\b`**: Matches the exact word "WORD".

### 5.2 Example

**Pattern**: `\bcat\b`

**Text**: "The cat sat on the mat."

```python
import re

text = "The cat sat on the mat."
pattern = r"\bcat\b"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['cat']
```

#### Explanation

This pattern uses word boundaries to find "cat" as a whole word in the text, ensuring it doesn't match substrings of larger words.

### 5.3 Start and End Anchors

The start `^` and end `$` of string anchors are used to match the beginning and end of the entire text, respectively.

- **`^Start`**: Matches "Start" at the beginning of the text.
- **`End$`**: Matches "End" at the end of the text.

### 5.4 Example

**Pattern**: `^The`

**Text**: "The start of the sentence."

```python
import re

text = "The start of the sentence."
pattern = "^The"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['The']
```

#### Explanation

The pattern `^The` matches the word "The" only if it appears at the start of the text.

### 5.5 Example

**Pattern**: `sentence.$`

**Text**: "This is the end of the sentence."

```python
import re

text = "This is the end of the sentence."
pattern = "sentence.$"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['sentence.']
```

#### Explanation

The pattern `sentence.$` matches "sentence." only if it is at the very end of the text.

## 6. Grouping and Capturing

Grouping and capturing allow you to treat multiple characters as a single unit, extract information from matches, and perform operations on captured groups.

### 6.1 Parentheses

Parentheses `()` are used in regular expressions to group parts of the pattern.

This can be useful for applying quantifiers to a sequence of characters or for isolating parts of a pattern for capturing or backreferencing.

### 6.2 Example

**Pattern**: `(ab)+`

**Text**: "ababab is a repetitive pattern."

```python
import re

text = "ababab is a repetitive pattern."
pattern = r"(ab)+"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Matches found:", matches)
```

#### Output

```
Matches found: ['ab']
```

#### Explanation

This pattern uses parentheses to group `ab` and apply the `+` quantifier, matching one or more occurrences of the "ab" sequence.

***IMPORTANT***: The output shows the last captured group.
  
### 6.4 Example

**Capturing Groups**: By default, groups created with parentheses not only group parts of the pattern but also capture the matched text for later use, such as extracting data.

**Pattern**: `(ab)(cd)`
**Text**: "abcdef"

```python
import re

text = "abcdef"
pattern = r"(ab)(cd)"

match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print("First group:", match.group(1))
    print("Second group:", match.group(2))
```

#### Output

```
First group: ab
Second group: cd
```

#### Explanation

This pattern captures two groups: `(ab)` and `(cd)`. The `.group(1)` and `.group(2)` methods are used to access these captured groups.

### 6.5 Example

**Non-Capturing Groups**: If you want to use parentheses to group parts of your pattern without capturing the matched text, you can use non-capturing groups syntax `(?:pattern)`.

**Pattern**: `(ab)(?:cd)`

**Text**: "abcdef"

```python
import re

text = "abcdef"
pattern = r"(ab)(?:cd)"

match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print("First group:", match.group(1))
    # Second group is not captured
```

#### Output

```
First group: ab
```

#### Explanation

The pattern `(ab)(?:cd)` captures "ab" as the first group and uses `(?:cd)` to group "cd" without capturing it. This allows for grouping without affecting the numbering of other capturing groups.

In some cases we can use the following flags:

| Flag | Modifier | Description | Example Use Case |
|------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Case Insensitivity | `re.IGNORECASE` or `re.I` | Makes the match case-insensitive, allowing patterns to match letters regardless of case. | Matching "cat", "Cat", "CAT", etc., with the same pattern. |
| Multiline | `re.MULTILINE` or `re.M` | Treats the start (`^`) and end (`$`) characters as working across multiple lines, allowing them to match at the start or end of any line within a string. | Matching patterns at the beginning or end of each line in a text block, rather than only at the very start or end. |
| Dot Matches All | `re.DOTALL` or `re.S` | Makes the dot (`.`) special character match all characters, including the newline character, which it does not match by default. | Matching across lines with a single pattern, where the newline character would typically stop the match. |


## 7. Practice

We will take a look at the couple of objectives, and the rest will be included into homework.

**Objective #1**:

```
Use regular expressions to identify and separate different sections of the text (e.g., Overview, Departments, Courses Offered, Notable Alumni, Contact Information).
```

**Objective #2**:

```
Find all instances of "University", "Department", and "Course" in the text, regardless of case.
```

**Objective #3:**

```
List all department names, assuming each is listed at the start of a new line following "Departments:".
```

**Objective #4:**

```
Extract the university's overview paragraph, including any newlines within it.
```

**Objective #5:**

```
Capture course names and categorize them as either "Introduction" or "Advanced".
```

**Objective #6**

```
Identify and extract email addresses and phone numbers
```

**Objective #7**

```
Highlight all exact occurrences of the words "Regex", "Text", and "Pattern"
```

    match = re.search(pattern, text, flags=re.DOTALL)
    if match:
        print("Overview:", match.group(1))
    return "Overview not found."

INFO Successful operation.
WARN System instability detected.
ERROR Unable to retrieve data.
WARN Check your network connection.
ERROR Disk full.
"""

def analyze_log(log):
    # Define regex here, btw it's a good case for using re.findall() ;)
    # Though it might be tricky, I beleive in you
