## 1. Strings in the PC memory (encodings, ascii/unicode), `ord()`, `chr()`

We have already worked with strings a lot, but really, how does it work under the hood?

### 1.1 How it works

Strings in a computer's memory are stored as sequences of `bytes`. To represent strings of text, a computer has a system that maps these byte `sequences` to `characters`. This system is called a character encoding.

Two common character encoding systems are `ASCII` and `Unicode`:

### 1.2 `ASCII` `(American Standard Code for Information Interchange)`

 It uses `7 bits` to represent `128 unique characters`, which includes letters, numbers, and control characters. 
 
***NOTE:*** ASCII is limited to English characters and _does not support_ international text.

![Alt text](images/ascii.png)

### 1.3 `Unicode` 


It is a comprehensive `encoding system` designed to represent text in most of the world's writing systems. Unlike ASCII, Unicode uses a variable-length encoding system, which can be `8`, `16`, or `32` bits long.


***NOTE***: This encoding allows to represent over a million unique characters.

![alt text](images/unicode.png)

### 1.4 `ord()`, `chr()`

`Python` provides two functions to interact with character encodings:



1. `ord(c)`: Given a string representing one Unicode character, `ord()` _returns an integer_ representing the `Unicode` code point of that character. For example, `ord('a')` returns the integer `97`.

2. `chr()` Given an integer representing a `Unicode` code point,` chr()` _returns a string representing the character_.

***NOTE***: This is not used in the production environments, but we will a have a homework based on this material, so get acquainted.

#### Example

```python
print(ord('a'))
print(chr('97'))
```

#### Output

```
97
a
```

These functions allow us to convert between a character's `byte` and its `str` representations.

It will be very helpful once we start working with files later.

### 2. String Formatting

`Python` provides several ways to format strings. Two common methods are `raw strings` and `formatted string literals`.


### 2.1 Raw Strings (`r` strings)
Raw strings are useful when you need to use lots of backslashes, like defining a file path on `Windows`/`Linux`/`Mac OS`. In a raw string, backslashes are treated as literal characters and not as escape characters, but as a part of the string.

#### Example
```python
path = r"C:\Users\Name\Documents\file.txt"
print(path)
```

#### Output
```
C:\Users\Name\Documents\file.txt
```

### 2.2 Formatted strings Literals (`f` strings)

Formatted string literals, or `f strings`, are a way to embed expressions inside string literals using curly braces `{}`. They are concise and easy to use for embedding variables and expressions within a string. 

It really simplifies life using them, just compare two `print()` statements shown in the example below:

#### Example
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25

# Without ``f`` strings
print("Hello, ", name, ".", "You are ", age, "years old.") 

# With ``f`` strings
greeting = f"Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old."
print(greeting)
```

#### Output

```
Hello, Alice. You are 25 years old.
```

## 3. Slicing

Slicing is a mechanism in `Python` which allows you to **extract a part of a string**, also known as a _substring_. 

### 3.1 The syntax

A slice is created by specifying two indices _**in square brackets**_, separated by a colon `[start:stop]` where  `start` <span style="color:green"> is the index where the slice starts </span> and `stop` <span style="color:red">is the index where the slice ends. </span> 

***NOTE***: The start index is included in the slice, but the stop index is not.

You can also include a 3rd parameter, `step`, which lets you skip characters within the slice `[start:stop:step]`.

Let's take a look closer on the table below:

| Index | 0   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  |
|-------|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Char  | a   | b  | c  | d  | e  | f  | g  | h  | i  | j  |
| Index | -10 | -9 | -8 | -7 | -6 | -5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 |

We can ommit some inidces, and the count will be started from the `start`/`end`

#### Example

```python
s = "abcdefghij"
print(s[1:5])  # Extracts from index 1 to 4
print(s[:5])   # Extracts from the beginning to index 4
print(s[7:])   # Extracts from index 7 to the end
print(s[:])    # Extracts the whole string
print(s[::2])  # Extracts every second character from the string
print(s[::-1]) # Reverses the string
```

#### Output

```
bcde
abcde
hij
abcdefghij
acegi
jihgfedcba
```

***NOTE***: Python also supports `negative` indices in slicing, which counts <span style="color:red"> from the end</span> of the string <span style="color:red">backwards</span> 

#### Example

```python
s = "abcdefghij"

print(s[-4:-1]) # Extracts from the fourth-last to the second-last character
print(s[:-5])   # Extracts from the beginning to the fifth-last character
print(s[-3:])   # Extracts the last three characters
print(s[::-2])  # Extracts every second character from the string in reverse
```

#### Output

```
ghi
abcde
hij
jhfdb
```

### 3.2 Assigments

There will be only 2 assigments in this section, but they are a little bit tricky, good luck!

#### Assignment 1: Reverse a String

**Objective**: Write a program that takes a string as input and returns it in reverse order using slicing.

```
# Sample Input: 'Python'
# Sample Output: 'nohtyP'
```

#### Assignment 2: Palindromic Phrase Verifier

**Objective**: Develop a program that checks whether a word is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

```
Input: The user inputs a word.
Output: The program states whether it is a palindrome.

Example:
Input: radar / level

Output:
This word is a palindrome.
```

## 4. Methods of Strings

In this section we will find out the real power of strings in `Python`.

### 4.1 Methods vs Functions

In Python, **functions** and **methods** both refer to blocks of code that perform tasks. <span style="color:red">The key difference</span> between them lies in _how they are used and invoked within the code._

### 4.1.1 Functions

A **function** is a standalone unit of code that performs a specific task. It can be called directly by its name and can work on different types of data. Functions can take inputs (arguments) and return outputs (results).

#### Example
```python
name = "Hello"
print(len(result))  # len() --> function
```

#### 4.1.2 Methods

A method is similar to a function, but <span style="color:red">it is associated with an object </span> and is called on that object using `dot(.)` notation.

```python
name = "hello"
print(result.capitalize())  # capitalize() --> method
```

You have to understand the following key points:

1. Functions are called by name and can be used independently of objects.
2. Methods are called on objects and often work with the data within those objects.

### 4.2 `dir()` and `help()`

The `dir()` function will list all the attributes of any object in `Python`.

#### Example

```python
print(dir(str))
```

#### Output
```
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', ... 'capitalize', 'casefold', 'center', 'count', 'encode', 'endswith', 'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', ...]
```

The `help()` function can be used to understand what a particular method does. 

```python
help(str.capitalize)
```

#### Output
```
Help on method_descriptor:

capitalize(self, /)
    Return a capitalized version of the string.
    
    More specifically, make the first character have upper case and the rest lower
    case.
```

These outputs will provide detailed information about the methods, which can be very helpful when you're trying to figure out how to use a particular string method or which method can be used on the object.

**Note**: Don't forget to refer to [the official documentation for `Python`](https://docs.python.org/3/)

### 4.3 Methods of strings

| Method              | Description                                                      | Example                | Output               |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| `capitalize()`      | Capitalizes the first letter of the string.                      | `'hello'.capitalize()` | `'Hello'`            |
| `casefold()`        | Converts string to lower case for caseless matching.             | `'HELLO'.casefold()`   | `'hello'`            |
| `center(width)`     | Centers the string within a specified width.                     | `'hello'.center(10)`   | `'   hello   '`      |
| `count(sub)`        | Returns the number of occurrences of a substring.                | `'hello'.count('l')`   | `2`                  |
| `endswith(suffix)`  | Checks if the string ends with the specified suffix.             | `'hello'.endswith('o')`| `True`               |
| `find(sub)`         | Searches the string for a specified substring and returns the index. | `'hello'.find('e')` | `1`                 |
| `format(*args)`     | Formats the string into a nicer output.                          | `'{} world'.format('hello')` | `'hello world'`|
| `replace(old, new)` | Replaces occurrences of a substring with another.                | `'hello'.replace('e', 'a')` | `'hallo'`       |
| `strip(chars)`      | Trims leading and trailing characters (whitespace by default).   | `'   hello   '.strip()`| `'hello'`            |
| `upper()`           | Converts all characters of the string to uppercase.              | `'hello'.upper()`      | `'HELLO'`            |

Methods below are used tightly with a `list` data structure, which we will learn during next lessons. We will take a closer look on them later, just bear in mind that they exist!

| Method              | Description                                                      | Example                | Output               |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| `join(iterable)`    | Joins the elements of an iterable by the string.                 | `'-'.join(['1', '2'])` | `'1-2'`              |
| `split(sep)`        | Splits the string at the specified separator.                    | `'1,2,3'.split(',')`   | `['1', '2', '3']`    |

### 4.4 Assignments

#### Assignment 1: The Name Corrector

**Objective**: Create a program that takes a user's name and ensures the first letter is capitalized and the rest are lowercase, regardless of how the user enters it.

```
Input: aLiCe        # Note, that you might want to use 2 methods to achieve the expected output
Output: Alice
```

#### Assignment 2: The Substring Counter

**Objective**: Write a script that counts the number of times a substring appears in a given string.

```

Enter the substring to count: ello

Output: The substring 'ello' appears 3 times in 'hellohellohello'.
```

### Assignment 3: The Alignment Formatter
**Objective**: Ask the user to enter a sentence and then display it centered within a `frame` of a specified width.

```
Input:
Enter your sentence: hello
Set the frame width: 4

Output:
    hello   
```

### Assignment 4: The Case Converter
**Objective**: Create a program that can convert a given string into either `uppercase` or `lowercase` based on the user's choice.

```

Enter your text: Python is Fun!
Choose 'upper' or 'lower': upper
Output: PYTHON IS FUN!
```

### Assignment 5: The URL Corrector
**Objective**: Write a program that ensures all URLs entered by a user start with `https://`. If it doesn't, add it to the beginning.

```
Input: Enter the URL: www.swetrix.com
Output: Corrected URL: https://www.swetrix.com
```

## 5. Introduction to loops

`Loops` are a powerful feature of computers, giving them the ability to perform _repetitive tasks_.


`Python` provides two primary types of loops:

- **_Counting Loops_** (`for`): Ideal for situations where  <span style="color:green">the number of iterations is known in advance.</span>
- **_Conditional Loops_** (`while`): These loops `continue` to execute <span style="color:orange">until a certain condition is met.</span>

#### Syntax

```python
for variable_name in range(number_of_iterations):
    code_block          
    # Note that we need to use indentation for this construction
```

#### Example
```python
for i in range(10):
    print("Hello")
```

#### Output
```
# 10 times
Hello
Hello
...
Hello
```

The purpose and function of the `loop variable` _may not be immediately obvious. Let's look at an example to clarify

#### Example
```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

#### Explanation

When the loop starts, `Python` assigns <span style="color:green">the initial value of the loop variable i to `0`</span>. 

With each iteration of the loop body, <span style="color:orange"> it increments the value of i by `1`</span>.

#### Output
```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

The diagram shows how `for` `loop` works in `Python`.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Initialize Loop Variable]
    B --> C{Condition Check}
    C -- True --> D[Execute Loop Body]
    D --> E[Increment Loop Variable]
    E --> C
    C -- False --> F[End]
```

### 5.1 Naming conventions in `Python`

Variable names for loops should be:

1.  Meaningful and descriptive
2. Shorter names are common as well. Generally, programmers use the letters `i`, `j`, `k` for loop variables.

#### Example

```python
# Common use
for i in range(10):         # j, k , etc..
    print(i)

# Meaningful and descriptive 
for number in range(10):
    print(number)
```

It is important you understand that the **_main goal_** is to <span n style="color:orange"> make code understandable </span> for people you are working with.

### 5.2 `range()`

The `range()` function in `Python` is used to generate a sequence of numbers. It is often used with the `for` loop to iterate over a sequence of numbers as you could see from the examples above.

To be more precise, we can say that the `range(n)` function generates a sequence of numbers from `0 to n-1`, and the for loop iterates through this sequence.

#### Example

```python
print(range(10))
```

#### Output 

```
range(0, 10)
```

### 5.3 Overloading of `range()`

The `range()` function in Python can take up to three parameters: `range(start, stop, step)`. Here's what each parameter represents:

- `start`: The <span style="color:green">beginning</span> of the sequence.
- `stop`: The <span style="color:red">end</span> of the sequence (exclusive --> `(stop-1)`).
- `step`: The <span style="color:orange">increment</span> between each number in the sequence.

| Function Call          | Description                      | Generated Sequence              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `range(1, 10, 2)`      | Starts at 1, ends before 10, steps by 2 | 1, 3, 5, 7, 9                  |
| `range(5, 30, 5)`      | Starts at 5, ends before 30, steps by 5 | 5, 10, 15, 20, 25              |
| `range(10, 1, -1)`     | Starts at 10, ends before 1, steps by -1 | 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2    |
| `range(20, 10, -2)`    | Starts at 20, ends before 10, steps by -2 | 20, 18, 16, 14, 12             |
| `range(3, 8, 1)`       | Starts at 3, ends before 8, steps by 1 | 3, 4, 5, 6, 7                  |
| `range(0, -10, -1)`    | Starts at 0, ends before -10, steps by -1 | 0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9 |


### 5.4 `for in` / `for in range()` 

There are two different ways to iterate through objects in python -> 

`for variable in ..` and `for variable in range()`


The `for in` loop is used to iterate over _**elements of a sequence**_, such as a `str`, `list`, `string`, `tuple`, or any `iterable object` which you will learn during the next lessons. 

This type of loop goes through each item in the sequence, _**one by one**_.


#### Syntax

```python
for element in iterable:
    # Do something with element
```

#### Example 

```python
s = 'Python'
for char in s:
    print(char)       # Directly accessing the elemenet 
```

We can iterate through the string using the following construction and `len()` function

```python
s = 'Python'
for index in range(len(s)):
    print(s[i])    # Accessing the element of the string using indexing
```

#### Output
```
P
y
t
h
o
n
```

### 5.5 When to Use Each Type of Loop?

Use `for in` when you have an iterable (like a `list` or `string`) and you want to perform actions <span style="color:orange">on each element.<span style="color:orange">

Use for `in range()` when you need to <span style="color:orange">repeat actions a specific number of times</span>, or when you need to <span style="color:orange">iterate using a counter. </span>

### Example

```python
# Don't forget that we can pas 1-3 arguments into the `range()` function
for i in range(2, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```

### Assignment 1: The Countdown Timer

**Objective**: Imagine that you are defusing a bomb which will explode in `n` seconds.

1. The program starts with a countdown from a given number `n` to `1`.
2. When the countdown reaches `1`, prompt the user to choose a wire to cut: `red` or `blue`.
3. If the user chooses `red`  -> the bomb explodes. 
4. If the user chooses `blue` -> the bomb is defused.
5. Make the application very interactive.  

```
Input: 
Enter the countdown time: 5

Output:
The bomb will explode in 5 seconds!
5
4
3
2
1
Quick! Which wire to cut? Red or Blue? 
User Input: Blue
Output: 
You cut the blue wire...
The bomb has been defused. Congratulations, you saved the day!

# Alternatively
User Input: Red
Output: 
You cut the red wire...
BOOM!!! The bomb exploded
```

### Assignment 2: The Fibonacci Sequence Generator
**Objective:** Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number.

Fibonacci Sequence Example:  `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,  21, 34, 55, 89,…`

```
Input: The user enters a number `n`.
Output: The program outputs the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

Example:
Input: 5
Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3
```


### Assignment 3  The Multiplication Table Printer

**Objective:** Create a script that prints the multiplication table for a number provided by the user.


```
Input: The user inputs a number.
Output: The program prints the multiplication table for that number.

Example:
Input: 3
Output:
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
...
3 x 10 = 30
```
