## 1. Concurrent Programming

The main problem of `Python` is being extremley slow in terms of perfomance. But we can achieve better results using practices described in sections [1-5], which is critical for developing high-performance applications in `Python`.

### 1.1 Definition

**Concurrency**: The ability of a program to be decomposed into parts that can run independently of each other. It's about dealing with lots of things at once.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Processor
    participant Task1
    participant Task2
    participant Task3
    Note over Processor: Single Processor
    Processor->>+Task1: Execute Task 1
    Note over Task1: Task 1 Processing
    Task1-->>-Processor: Pause Task 1
    Processor->>+Task2: Execute Task 2
    Note over Task2: Task 2 Processing
    Task2-->>-Processor: Pause Task 2
    Processor->>+Task3: Execute Task 3
    Note over Task3: Task 3 Processing
    Task3-->>-Processor: Pause Task 3
    Processor->>+Task1: Resume Task 1
    Note over Task1: Continue Processing
    Task1-->>-Processor: Complete Task 1
```

### 1.2 The Restaurant Kitchen

**Objective**: The kitchen has one head chef (the processor) and several tasks that need to be done to prepare a meal, such as chopping vegetables and grilling meats.

To represent the concurrency correctly, chef is moving between all tasks. 

### 1.2.1 Concurrent 

Let's take a look at how should it work:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Chef as Head Chef
    participant Task1 as Chopping Vegetables
    participant Task2 as Grilling Meat
    Note over Chef: Manages Tasks
    Chef->>+Task1: Start Chopping
    Note over Task1: Vegetables Being Chopped
    Task1-->>-Chef: Complete Chopping
    Chef->>+Task2: Start Grilling
    Note over Task2: Meat on Grill
    Task2-->>-Chef: Complete Grilling

```

#### Explanation

- **Head Chef (Processor)**: Manages and switches between tasks, but can physically only do one task at a time.
- **Tasks (Concurrent Processes)**: Chopping vegetables, grilling meats, These tasks are set up and monitored concurrently.
- **Efficiency**: By managing multiple tasks and moving between them, the kitchen operates much faster.

Chef is able to perform only one task at a time (due to single-threading / GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) in `Python` ), though all components of the meal are prepared concurrently.

GIL will be covered during the next lesson, for now just try to understand the idea behind concurrent programming.

### 1.2.2 Synchronous

In a synchronous kitchen operation, tasks are completed one after another without overlap. The head chef focuses on one task completely before moving on to the next task.

That's the way we implemented applications before.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Chef as Head Chef
    participant Task1 as Chopping Vegetables
    participant Task2 as Grilling Meat
    Note over Chef: Manages Tasks Sequentially
    Chef->>+Task1: Start and Complete Chopping
    Note over Task1: Vegetables Being Chopped
    Task1-->>-Chef: Chopping Complete
    Chef->>+Task2: Start and Complete Grilling
    Note over Task2: Meat on Grill
    Task2-->>-Chef: Grilling Complete
```

### 1.3 The Bank

**Objective**: Imagine a bank with a single service counter and multiple customers needing different services: depositing checks, withdrawing cash, and consulting on loan products.

### 1.3.1 Concurrent

In a concurrent version, multiple clerks (processors) are available to handle different banking tasks simultaneously,leading to efficient customer service and reduced waiting times.

This setup allows the bank to serve multiple customers at the same time, with each clerk focused on a specific task.

Let's take a look at how such model works in practice:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Clerk1 as Clerk 1 (Loans)
    participant Clerk2 as Clerk 2 (Deposits)
    participant Clerk3 as Clerk 3 (Withdrawals)
    participant C1 as Customer 1
    participant C2 as Customer 2
    participant C3 as Customer 3
    Note over Clerk1, Clerk3: Clerks Handle Different Tasks
    C1->>+Clerk1: Start Loan Consultation
    Note over Clerk1: Consulting Customer 1
    C2->>+Clerk2: Deposit Checks
    Note over Clerk2: Serving Customer 2
    C3->>+Clerk3: Withdraw Cash
    Note over Clerk3: Assisting Customer 3
    Clerk1-->>-C1: Consultation Complete
    Clerk2-->>-C2: Deposit Complete
    Clerk3-->>-C3: Withdrawal Complete
```

#### Explanation

- **Clerks (Processors)**: Each clerk is capable of handling a different banking task simultaneously.
- **Tasks (Concurrent Processes)**: Loan consultations, depositing checks, and withdrawing cash are examples of tasks being handled concurrently.
- **Efficiency**: This concurrent operation allows the bank to maximize its throughput, serving more customers efficiently and reducing overall wait times.

### 1.3.2 Synchronous

In a smaller bank with only one clerk, customers must be served one at a time. This synchronous approach means the clerk focuses on completing one customer's transaction before starting the next.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Clerk as Bank Clerk
    participant C1 as Customer 1 (Loans)
    participant C2 as Customer 2 (Deposits)
    participant C3 as Customer 3 (Withdrawals)
    Note over Clerk: One Clerk Handling All Services
    Clerk->>+C1: Serve Customer 1
    Note over C1: Loan Consultation
    C1-->>-Clerk: Consultation Complete
    Clerk->>+C2: Serve Customer 2
    Note over C2: Depositing Checks
    C2-->>-Clerk: Deposit Complete
    Clerk->>+C3: Serve Customer 3
    Note over C3: Withdrawing Cash
    C3-->>-Clerk: Withdrawal Complete
```

Again, this may lead to increased wait times, which is a bad case for our application. That's why concurrent approach will be the best in terms of building your applications.

## 2. Parallel Programming

As processors have evolved, increasing their clock speed has become more challenging due to physical and thermal limitations.

The solution has been to add more cores, allowing for more operations to be carried out simultaneously.

Parallel programming is designed to take advantage of this architecture by dividing tasks across these cores, significantly speeding up processing times for suitable tasks.

### 2.1 Definition

**Parallel programming**: is an approach that allows for the execution of many computations or processes simultaneously.

### 2.2 Image Processing App

**Objective**: In a photo editing application, multiple images need to be processed to apply a filter. Each image can be processed independently of the others, making this task an excellent candidate for parallel programming.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Distribute Tasks}
    B --> C[Process Image 1]
    B --> D[Process Image 2]
    B --> E[Process Image 3]
    C --> F[Combine Results]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[End]
```

#### Explanation

- **Task Distribution**: The application divides the batch of images into individual tasks.
- **Parallel Processing**: Each image is processed in parallel, utilizing separate CPU cores.
- **Efficiency**: This approach significantly reduces the total processing time compared to processing each image sequentially.


Just as in life, time is the most valuable asset which should be used accordingly, that's why we usually refer to techniquest above - to save some time, even if it's a time of execution.

## 3 Key Differences

Let's summarise everything into the table, so that during designing of your application, you as a programmer would refer to:

| Aspect          | Concurrent Programming                                                                 | Parallel Programming                                                                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**  | Focuses on managing and executing multiple tasks that can run independently but not necessarily simultaneously. | Involves executing multiple computations or processes simultaneously, typically by utilizing multiple CPU cores. |
| **Execution**   | Tasks are decomposed into parts that can run independently, often interleaved or overlapping in time. | Tasks are executed at the same time, utilizing the computing power of multiple processing units. |
| **Use Case**    | Best for I/O-bound operations where tasks spend a significant amount of time waiting for external operations like network or disk I/O. | Best for CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation and can be divided into independent subtasks for simultaneous execution. |
| **Python Tools** | `Threading`, `AsyncIO`                                                                    | `Multiprocessing`, `concurrent.futures` `(ProcessPoolExecutor)`                             |
| **GIL Impact**  | Affected by Python's GIL, making true parallel execution of threads impossible in CPython. However, tasks that are I/O-bound can still benefit from concurrency. | Bypasses the GIL by using separate processes instead of threads, allowing true parallel execution of code. |

Happy self-reflection and welcome to the Fast Python!

Sorry for raw and boring theory, without it we won't be able to create async applications.
